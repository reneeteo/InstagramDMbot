# InstagramDMbot
I created this just to increase efficiency at expanding outreach for a project I was doing. 
Follows and DMs a list of usernames automatically with Python Selenium

1. Edit file and key in own username and password
2. Add your own message (and image) 
3. Have a list of usernames, can be imported by csv or otherwise, split into chunks so that Instagram doesn't detect the bot.
